Here we are, our repo of the NASA hackathon app challenge 2024 GBG!

## High-Level Summary
We are developing an application that enables farmers to understand in a simple manner key aspects of agriculture which impacts the health of their crops and conditions of their soil.

## Project Demo
N/A

## Final Project
N/A

## Project Details
Using React, UI Components. Our application enables farmers to have a simple understanding of their soil data and the surrounding environmental conditions that affect the health of their land without all the complexities of processing or interpreting large datasets which if the everyday individual looks at that and does not understand, how can they farmers be expected to understand? We keep things simple and intuitive.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence
We used Claude.ai to get examples of what data we can get from APIs, process the data without having to go through entire large datasets and visualizing the data in combination with the thought process we have with the idea, editing and modifying conditions we determined were irrelevant and adding information that adds better usability.
